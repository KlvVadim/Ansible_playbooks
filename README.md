# Ansible_playbooks
This is just a repo of Ansible playbooks that I wrote for my work as a Linux administrator, starting from simple scripts and ending with relatively complex ones, such as JenkinsSlavePlugins_install.yml and Elasticsearch\Logstash\Kibana_version_upgrade.yml files.
The main goal of this repository is to showcase my skills in using Ansible as an automation tool.
