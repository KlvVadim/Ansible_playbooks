ansible-galaxy info geerlingguy.elasticsearch (to see how many downloaded)

Create your own role structure automatically:
ansible-galaxy init yourrolename

search in cli:
ansible-galaxy search rolename
ansible-galaxy info rolename
ansible-galaxy install rolename
(by default it will be installed in  /root/.ansible/roles/role_name)

ansible-galaxy remove <role> 


ansible-galaxy list  --> list all the roles and role versions you have installed
ansible-config dump | grep -i ROLE



role --> tasks dir --> main.yml

You don't have to create the entire role dir structure, just tasks with main.yml is enough

In playbook you can have both - roles and tasks:
- name: Installing app
  hosts: all
  roles:  #(order of roles is important)
	- python
    - web
   
	
Looks for role in the same folder where the playbooks is - create dir named roles over there or in default location: /etc/ansible/roles

	
Roles collection - https://galaxy.ansible.com/home (must to login to upload role)
